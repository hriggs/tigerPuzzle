1. First Trial:
The sign on door one says, In this room their is one of your true loves, and in
the other room there is a tiger.
The sign on door two says, In one of these rooms there sits one of your true loves, and in one of these rooms there is a tiger.
The evil jailer, who curiosly never lies, adds that one of the statements is true and one is false! What should the prisoner do?

2. Second Trial:
The statement on door one says, At least one of these rooms contains a true
love.‚Äù
The statement on door two says, A tiger is in the other room. The evil jailer, who curiosly never lies, adds that
the two statements are either both true or both false.
Which door should the prisoner open in order to avoid being eaten alive and find a true love?

3. The Third Trial:
The statement on door one says, Either a tiger is in this room or your true love
is in the other room.
The statement on door two says, There is a tiger in one room and your true love in the other room.
Again, the jailer claims that either both are true or both are false. Which should the prisoner open?

4. The Fourth Trial:
The sign on the first door says, At least one room contains a true love.
The sign on the second door says, This room contains a tiger.
As the puzzled prisoner reads these signs, the jailer laughs and says: If a true love is behind door one, the sign on that door is true, otherwise it is false!
Help out the prisoner! What choice should the prisoner make?
