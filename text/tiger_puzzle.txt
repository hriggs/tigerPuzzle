BEHIND EACH DOOR I HAVE PLACED EITHER A HUNGRY TIGER OR ONE OF YOUR TRUE LOVES. 
TIGERS COULD BE BEHIND ALL THE DOORS OR ONE OF YOUR TRUE LOVES COULD BE BEHIND EACH DOOR. 
ON EACH DOOR IS A SIGN THAT IS EITHER TRUE OR FALSE. 
THE ONLY CONCESSION I HAVE MADE IS THAT THE SIGNS ON THE DOORS ARE CONSISTENT 
WITH WHAT IS BEHIND THE DOORS! IN EACH CASE YOU MUST CHOOSE A DOOR!
